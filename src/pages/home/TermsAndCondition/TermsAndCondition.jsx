          These terms and conditions and the documents referred and linked to

          Please read these terms very carefully as they form a binding legal
          agreement between you - our customer (the “Customer”) - and us. By
          opening an account (the “Account”) and using the Service you agree to
          be bound by these terms, together with any amendment which may be
          published from time to time.

        <h2>General Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to amend the terms (including to any documents
          referred and linked to below) at any time. When such amendment is not
          substantial, we may not provide you with prior notice. You will be
          notified in advance for material changes to the terms and may require
          you to re-confirm acceptance to the updated terms before the changes
          come into effect. If you object to any such changes, you must
          immediately stop using the service and the termination provisions
          below will apply. Continued use of the service indicates your
          agreement to be bound by such changes. Any bets not settled prior to
          the changed terms taking effect will be subject to the pre-existing
          terms.
